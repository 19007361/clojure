# Clojure Ring / ClojureScript Reagent Demonstration


## NOTE!

This project is still work in progress. I'll finalize this README.md and remove this NOTE! chapter once I'm done with this project.

## Introduction

The demonstration has two parts:

1. **Simple Server** implemented using [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure).
2. **Simple Frontend** implemented using [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/).

## Rationale for Creating the Demonstration

The rationale to create this demonstration was to learn how to use ClojureScript to implement a Single Page Application (SPA). I have previously implemented one production SPA using [Angular](https://angular.io/). Now I wanted to learn to use the excellent Clojure language to implement SPAs and compare my experiences to use Javascript / ClojureScript and Angular / React (Reagent) implementing SPAs. In [A Real-World Comparison of Front-End Frameworks with Benchmarks (2018 update)](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-real-world-comparison-of-front-end-frameworks-with-benchmarks-2018-update-e5760fb4a962) article  ClojureScript won in the Lines of Code category (and didn't do that bad in other categories as well). So, learning ClojureScript could be a good addition to my skill set. 

Another reason to create this demonstration was also to deepen my Clojure / Ring / Compojure skills to implement a more functional server with Web services APIs, authentication, JSON web token etc. And of course learn how to integrate the ClojureScript frontend to the Clojure backend and how to do efficient development in both sides.
