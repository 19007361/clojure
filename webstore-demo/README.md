# Webstore Demonstration

The original Webstore demonstration is under [clj-ring-cljs-reagent-demo](../clj-ring-cljs-reagent-demo) directory for historical reasons (there are Blog links to that directory etc.).

I started a [re-implementation of the Simple Server](simple-server) - the idea was to learn deps.edn and new more effective ways to use repl. The API should be exactly same as in the old Simple Server (and actually with all Simple Servers implemented in Clojure, Javascript/Node, Java, Python and Go).
